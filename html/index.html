    <h1>An introduction to ChatGPT for educators</h1>

                      <p>Hi, I'm <a href="https://jonathansoma.com/" target="_blank">Soma</a>! I run the <a href="https://journalism.columbia.edu/data" target="_blank">Data Journalism program</a> at Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. Let's talk about ChatGPT and all those other AI tools that have been flooding the news lately.</p>

            <div class="slide-notes">
                      <p>Before we even get to what these tools are, a full disclaimer is that I love ChatGPT and all of the other popular modern AI based tools. I am wholly and completely biased.</p>

      <p>Last week I even taught the opposite of this class - instead of instructors it was for students, and it was all about how to more or less learn to code a web scraper through ChatGPT instead of listening to someone like me drone on and on.</p>

      <p>But yes, I'm a big fan! I use ChatGPT-like tools in my own work (specifically <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot" target="_blank">Github Copilot</a> in Visual Studio Code) and because I teach my students how to use these students to simplify their workflows. It's easy for me because I'm mostly focused on programming, and how to use programming to get to solutions and analyze data. It's more about the concepts and less "write me a paper."</p>

            </div>
            <div class="slide-notes">
                      <p>But even if I love these tools, according to anything I've read in the news for the past two months, though, ChatGPT is the absolute destruction death knell of education. No one is going to do anything anymore except cheat! So we're all doomed.</p>

      <p>But first, what is ChatGPT?</p>


            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="slide slide--bordered">
            <div class="slide-image">
                <a href="images/images.004.jpg"><img src="images/images.004.jpg" alt="Image of slide number 4" /></a>
            </div>
            <div class="slide-notes">
                      <p>ChatGPT is a chatbot. You type things to it, it types things back.</p>

      <p>Chatbots have been around forever, but the secret about ChatGPT is that it's really really good. It's read the entire internet (and more), knows more than everyone in this room put together, and is even better at communication than someone with an English degree who has been through years of therapy.</p>

      <p>Technically speaking it's a generative large language model (LLM), but we don't absolutely care about the technical things going on here. We actually don't even care about ChatGPT, it's just one example.</p>


            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="slide slide--bordered">
            <div class="slide-image">
                <a href="images/images.005.jpg"><img src="images/images.005.jpg" alt="Image of slide number 5" /></a>
            </div>
            <div class="slide-notes">
                      <p>There are a lot of new tools, so we aren't going to become experts at them all. We're going to think about them in the abstract, see their abilities, think about where they might go. So while we're talking about ChatGPT, know that in three months from now when we start talking about some other tool all of the same lessons – and many of the same weaknesses – probably apply.</p>


            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="slide slide--bordered">
            <div class="slide-image">
                <a href="images/images.006.jpg"><img src="images/images.006.jpg" alt="Image of slide number 6" /></a>
            </div>
            <div class="slide-notes">
                      <p>But before we demo ChatGPT, a question for you: is using Grammarly cheating?</p>

      <p>We have a lot of international students, a lot of folks for whom English is a second language. Is getting language tweaks from a robot like Grammarly or a writing coach or a roommate something that's a problem?</p>

      <p>And why?</p>

      <p>Great, now let's look at how ChatGPT works. We aren't talking about journalism yet, we're just talking about the tool itself.</p>


            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="slide slide--bordered">
            <div class="slide-image">
                <a href="images/images.007.jpg"><img src="images/images.007.jpg" alt="Image of slide number 7" /></a>
            </div>
            <div class="slide-notes">
                      <p>Ask it for some information, it gives you some information. This isn't just some random person's sugar cookie recipe, it's a distillation of all the sugar cookie recipes on the internet! Just like how you'd read like sixteen recipes and weigh them each and pick a few to use as the basis for your own, that's just how ChatGPT works.</p>

      <p>This is kind of impressive, but it's not why ChatGPT is famous. ChatGPT is famous because, as a "generative language model," it... generates things that are startling human.</p>


            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="slide slide--bordered">
            <div class="slide-image">
                <a href="images/images.008.jpg"><img src="images/images.008.jpg" alt="Image of slide number 8" /></a>
            </div>
            <div class="slide-notes">
                      <p>First off, this does not sound like Hemingway.</p>

      <p>It does sound like the beginning of a cyberpunk noir novel where the main character is an avian cyborg with an addiction to homemade sugar cookies, though.</p>

      <p>Which I think is impressive! It's creative and thoughtful and plays on tropes and has everything you'd like to see. This is what the internet loves to show you with ChatGPT, but it definitely isn't journalism.</p>

      <p>So in order to terrify and inspire you I'm going to walk a straw man of a Reporting class, and how a savvy student might leverage ChatGPT every step of the way. And we'll start with something very simple.</p>


            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="slide slide--bordered">
            <div class="slide-image">
                <a href="images/images.009.jpg"><img src="images/images.009.jpg" alt="Image of slide number 9" /></a>
            </div>
            <div class="slide-notes">
                      <p>Cheating. Simple cheating. If you were worried about plagiarism through cutting and pasting from Wikipedia or existing news articles, this is hundreds of steps worse.</p>

      <p>You can't just google the text the student writes because in the same way that the sugar cookie was a distillation of everything ChatGPT knows about sugar cookies, each answer that ChatGPT gives is going to be fresh and new content based on an idea, not just cut and paste.</p>

      <p>And it's probably going to be different every single time you ask it a question.</p>


            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="slide slide--bordered">
            <div class="slide-image">
                <a href="images/images.010.jpg"><img src="images/images.010.jpg" alt="Image of slide number 10" /></a>

            <div class="slide-notes">
                      <p>So, our first prompt! One-paragraph pitch about the NYC public transit system. Real baby basic stuff, something relatable and researchable and easily improved.</p>

      <p>And easily fed into ChatGPT.</p>

      <p>First: is this cheating?</p>

      <p>Second, what do we think about it? Boring, right?</p>


            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="slide slide--bordered">

            <div class="slide-notes">
                      <p>Don't worry, ChatGPT is like your very best student in that it loves to get and incorporate feedback.</p>


            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="slide slide--bordered">

            <div class="slide-notes">
                      <p>How's this one? Better?</p>

      <p>Is it cheating if a student feeds their own pitch into ChatGPT?</p>

      <p>Okay, writing simple pitches is going to be trouble. What's the next step that you might have students take after writing a pitch, or along with submitting a pitch? </p>


            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="slide slide--bordered">
            <div class="slide-image">
                <a href="images/images.013.jpg"><img src="images/images.013.jpg" alt="Image of slide number 13" /></a>
            </div>
            <div class="slide-notes">
                      <p>The "chatbot" part of ChatGPT really shines because it knows what we're already talked about. As you saw with the editing, we can actually have a discussion about the pitch.</p>

      <p>So anything you can ask your students to do, your student can ask ChatGPT to do.</p>


            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="slide slide--bordered">

            <div class="slide-notes">
                      <p>These responses are pretty generic, but how does this compare to what your students produce? What would your feedback be?</p>

      <p>Is this cheating?</p>

      <p>Your students should be able to do this themselves, but I'm not really impressed with either the prompt or the output. What differentiates two students who are working on this project? Maybe the quality of their interviews?</p>


            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="slide slide--bordered">
            <div class="slide-image">

            <div class="slide-notes">
                      <p>How would we rate these interview questions? Give me a percentile. Mediocre? Awful? How does this compare to your other students?</p>

      <p>Is it cheating to have ChatGPT generate interview questions? Is this useful to a student to see? What could we do to make this a useful exercise?</p>

      <p>These are pretty boring, not a real deep dive. If we go back to the last prompt, though, which one of these seems to be the most interesting to interview?</p>

      <p>I personally love the idea of a transit engineer, but how in the world are you going to find one? What ideas do you have?</p>


            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="slide slide--bordered">

            </div>
            <div class="slide-notes">
                      <p>Obviously, we can just ask ChatGPT. Is this cheating? Or is the outreach the important part?</p>

      <p>How would we find "industry publications that cover transportation engineering?" Yeah, sure, just ask ChatGPT.</p>


            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="slide slide--bordered">
            <div class="slide-image">

            <div class="slide-notes">
                      <p>Now this is great, I love this. I love this and I hate it. First, is this cheating?</p>

      <p>Second, this is one of the first times ChatGPT has been specific. Here are SPECIFIC PUBLICATIONS AND JOURNALS! Perfect, right?</p>

      <p>A word of caution when you get to this point is that once you start asking ChatGPT about specifics it loves to start lying to you. Technically speaking this is called "hallucinating," because I think lying is too intentional or casts this work in a bad light, but ChatGPT will state things that are completely untrue and claim that yes, it's a fact, don't even think about disagreeing.</p>

      <p>Do we think anything on here might be untrue, might need a fact check or a follow-up?</p>


            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="slide slide--bordered">

                      <p>Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice is a completely legitimate journal and is on Volume 169. I could not believe it.</p>

      <p>So besides the potential for hallucinations, what's a downside of getting all of your answers through talking to ChatGPT?</p>

                      <p>So far most everything from ChatGPT has been just reasonable. Nothing too insightful, nothing too awful, really just middling.</p>

      <p>At this point I feel like it's remarkably similar to students using Wikipedia. What are Wikipedia's strengths and weaknesses? How boring are the things you find on it? Do students need to follow citations to find better material? How does it compare to what we've seen so far with ChatGPT.</p>

      <p>The text is predictable – boring by design, almost – in that each word can be predicted from the word before it. "I am hungry, I am going to the _____" is it store? Grocery store? Restaurant? Many of these tools measure how unpredictable each word is to see whether you have a human making wild choices or an AI tool making safe bets.</p>

                      <p>This detector is very famous, it's called GPTZero, and it claims things like "millions of educators have signed up!" and "we're the best!" but that's all marketing and a fun name. It doesn't actually do a good job detecting our ChatGPT AI story as being written by a robot.</p>

                      <p>I will say that oftentimes you plug in a generic lead into an AI detector and it has says there's a 50/50 chance it was written by an AI tool. That's just because a lot of the way journalism is written is boring and predictable and follows a pattern!</p>

      <p>It's hard to reproduce when using news, because... news is news because it's new, but if your students are writing evergreen stories there's a good chance they'll be flagged as a bot.</p>

      <p>If your student had an AI-written story, why don't they just ask an AI to make it sound more like a human? So that's what I did.</p>

                      <p>This has all been about how students can use ChatGPT, but I want to sneak in my favorite reason why we as instructors can use it. Not for homework, not for assignments, but for letters of recommendation!</p>

                      <p>They are a pain in the ass but NO LONGER. Give it a list of bullet points and there you go!</p>

      <p>You can also provide follow-up suggestions like "add more specific details" or "make it a stronger recommendation." I love it, and your students will love your ability to submit these recommendations in a timely manner, too.</p>

                      <p>In a lot of the stories you've been reading about ChatGPT, it's all about defensive moves. I personally think being offensive and using ChatGPT is a better route, but you'll need to decide on how that works best for your classes.</p>

                      <p>Here are my suggestions! I know everyone will have a different level of comfort, so it can range from being completely grumpy and saying no no no to tools like ChatGPT, or going out in full-throated support for them.</p>

      <p>The final one is my favorite. The ability to write custom material for each and every student to have them edit in class, or ask ChatGPT to do a "2 truths and a lie" about a topic that the students need to research, or even provide them with ChatGPT pitches on their beat and have them critique them. The possibilities are endless!</p>
