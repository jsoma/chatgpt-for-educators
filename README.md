# ChatGPT for Educators

A talk on AI tools in the classroom I initially gave at an adjunct retreat for Columbia Journalism School.

The recent spate of news articles seem to be a lot of doom and gloom about how it's going to ruin education, but without any concrete examples of *how* or suggestions on either sidestepping it or make it work for your classroom. So I wrote this talk to try to fill that gap!

While it's specifically focused on ChatGPT (because that's what's Popular At The Moment), the concepts can be applied to most any tool.

I'm supposed to be talking while you stare at my slides, but you can check out [the online version](https://jonathansoma.com/chatgpt-for-educators/) for a decent substitute.
